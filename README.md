# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles

## How to use
Run `setup_env.sh`. That's it.

## What's included
1. Terminal centric tools and configurations
2. Lazyvim as the editor of choice `scripts/install_lazyvim_bundle.sh`
3. Tmux for terminal multiplexing, mostly for remote work
4. Personal dotfiles for bash, vim, tmux, etc. Installation of fzf, conda, and zoxide included

## Test the scripts
All the scripts are tested on docker containers. To build and run the scripts execute `build_test_container.sh`. Append the -h flag to see the available options.
