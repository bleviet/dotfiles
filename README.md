# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles

## How to use
Run `setup`. That's it.

## What's included
1. Terminal centric tools and configurations, use Homebrew as the package manager
2. Lazyvim as the editor of choice
3. Tmux for terminal multiplexing, mostly for remote work
4. Personal dotfiles for bash, vim, tmux, etc. Shell startup initializes tools like fzf and zoxide when installed

## Test the scripts
All the scripts are tested on docker containers. To build and run the scripts execute `build_test_containers.sh`. Append the -h flag to see the available options.
